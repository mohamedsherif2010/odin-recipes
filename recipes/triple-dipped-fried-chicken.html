            <ul>
                <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
                <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</li>
                <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</li>
                <li>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
